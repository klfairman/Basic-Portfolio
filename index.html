    <p> My name is Kristen Fairman and life has taken me in a number of directions.  During school I was actively involved in Nordic
        Skiing which taught me the value of hard work and allowed me to travel the world. I was a member of the US Development Team 
        at an early age and raced at the Division 1 level at
        Middlebury College in Vermont. While there I studied Geography, Architectural History and Design, and developed
        a passion for the Russian language.</p> 
    
        
        <p>After graduation I moved back to Minnesota where I began working as a certified personal trainer while simultaneously 
        pursuing a Master of Arts in Teaching.  After discovering that teaching at the elementary school level was not my calling,
        I moved to Chicago where I completed my Master of Arts in Forensic Psychology and worked as a Data Analyst for The Chicago
        School of Professional Psychology.  Upon returning to Minnesota, I began a doctoral program in Clinical Psychology and worked
        in transitional care for adults with co-morbid chemical dependency and mental illness. Finding this work draining, I began to look
        for other career paths that could combine my passion for language, design, psychology, and creativity.  This is where I find myself
        pursuing coding and web development as my future career.</p>
